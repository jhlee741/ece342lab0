      <description>The SDCARD Polling project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes/erases the SD card continusly. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver andshow how to use polling based transfer API in SDHC driver in SDK software to access SD card.Note: If DATA3 is used as the card detect PIN, please make sure DATA3 is pull down, no matter internal or external, at the same time, make sure the card can pull DATA3 up, then host can detect card through DATA3.And SDHC do not support detect card through CD by host, card can be detected through DATA3 or GPIO.No matter detect card through host or gpio, make sure the pinmux configuration is correct.</description>
